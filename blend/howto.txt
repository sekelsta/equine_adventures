Art status:

zebra-imperial-adult:
animations exported from blender, untouched. Before export, cyclic animations (walk, trot, and gallop) were edited to fit fully within the frame period (exportreadyanims file)

zebra-imperial-foal:
- sit, sleep, and dead animations adjusted to properly be positioned on the ground
- trot animation has hooves colliding, but was not adjusted to fix it
